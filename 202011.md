| 2020-11-06 | [Towards a BRICS Optical Transient Network (BRICS-OTN)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02892) | + New, global survey network consisting 70 1-m telescopes that will survey the 4pi sky down to r=20-21 with a cadence of <1 hour <br> + Total cost over 10 years is 280M Euro |
| 2020-11-06 | [Orbital Foregrounds for Ultra-Short Duration Transients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02495) | + Systematic study of sub-second flashes caused by satellites using Evryscope <br> + Measured rate: 1800/hour over the entire sky, with magnitude peaks at g=13.0; the rate is oders of magnitude higher than transient rates, but coincidence (assuming arcminutes precision of events such as FRBs) is only 1e-5, and is unlikely <br> + Starlink unlikely to contribute to the rate of flashes |
