| 2019-05-01 | [Oort cloud asteroids: Collisional evolution, the Nice Model, and the Grand Tack](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03199) | + Considered the Nice model, the Grand Tack, and migration-less scenario to see how many Oort cloud asteroids (i.e. Manx comet) should we see -- based on a single detection of such object (2014 S3) <br> + Background info: Grand Tack is something that happended in the first 5 Myr of the solar system, Nice model happened 500 Myr later; Grand Tack described migrations of gas giants in the very early age of solar system and provided initial condition for the Nice model (which described another set of migrations) <br> + Oort cloud asteroids can only be reproduced by the Grand Tack scenario (because only in that scenario, Jupiter migrated to 1.5 au and scattered hot asteroids into Oort cloud region?)
| 2019-05-01 | [A hypothesis for the rapid formation of planets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04451) | + Discussed production rates of interstellar objects (ISOs) during different stage of stellar/planetary system; formation stage of protoplanetary cloud can produce a large number of ISOs, followed by planetary migration and white dwarf expansion <br> + In particular, successive generations of star formations will accumulate ISOs in the galaxy, which could (as the authors hypothesized) accelerate formation of planets in next-generation planetary systems
| 2019-05-01 | [Terrestrial deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio in water in hyperactive comets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09175) | + Presented SOFIA/GREAT data of 46P/Wirtanen (509/547 GHz observation of HDO transition), showed that the D/H ratio is consistent with Earth's water <br> + Went on and showed that D/H and active fraction of the comet is correlated; more active comets have lower D/H; reach Earth's D/H when active fraction approaches 1 (me: could there be some sort of observational bias there? Or geophysical process on the comet?)
| 2019-05-02 | [Exocometary Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02715) | <strong> + Astro2020 white paper</strong> <br> + Main importance of exocomets: enable insight into young solar nebula and comparison with solar system comets, understand volatile delivery into the inner regions of planetary systems; star-gazing comets and inner exozodi belts enable dynamical insights into inward scattering process that involves inner rocky planets <br> + Most detections so far are in 10-100 Myr old systems that are undergoing final stages of terrestrial planet formation <br> + Short-term: JWST, WFIRST, PLATO will advance the field; long-term: LUVOIR, Origins to conduct full-fledged exploration of the full composition of exocomets, to understand chemical heritage of young exo-Earths <br> + Noted two future directions: high-contrast imaging using JWST and WFIRST to study exozodi and transiting exocomets, inform models of inward scattering and constrain rates of inward delivery; mid to far IR, submm to mm, and radio wavelengths are useful for the study of cometary composition; far IR at 119 um is particularly important for longer-lived photodissociation product of water: OH <br> + No mention of solar system comets
| 2019-05-02 | [Effect of dust size and structure on scattered light images of protoplanetary discs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01890) | + Polarization observation is useful for probing dust larger than wavelength, highly porous dust are highly polarized and vice versa; examined behavior in NIR (1.6 micron in particular) of different configrations
| 2019-05-02 | [The dynamics of rings around Centaurs and Trans-Neptunian Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04851) | + Aside from simply detecting the rings, observational study (direct imaging, spectroscopy) remain difficult at this stage <br> + Non-axisymmetric shape of the small bodies can introduce strong resonances of the spin rate of the body and mean motion of the ring particles (which can keep the ring alive for longer period?) -- origin of the ring remain debated at this point
| 2019-05-02 | [Local manifestations of cometary activity](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05607) | <strong>+ SSR review of in-situ observation of cometary activity and its nature, physics of cometary matter on surface</strong> <br> + The "activity paradox" on comets: gas pressure provided by sublimating water molecules at perihelion temperatures is about 1 Pa, sufficient to kick 10 cm sized particles into space, but cannot overcome the cohesion of cometary matter (measured to be Pa-kPa level) and detach them from the surface <br> + Ways out: either dust-ice ratio is small (<1) so dust do not touch each other, or local cohesive weakness in the microstructure of cometary surface allows gas pressure to clear the dust from the surface; call more lab/numerical work and future in-situ mission
| 2019-05-06| [Outgassing As Trigger of 1I/'Oumuamua's Nongravitational Acceleration: Could This Hypothesis Work at All?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00935) | + It is improbable that water-ice sublimation can make that large non-grav acceleration; advocating the hypothesis of disrupting dwarf comet that disintegrated "weeks" before perihelion
| 2019-05-06 | [The 2019 Taurid resonant swarm: prospects for ground detection of small NEOs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01260) | + Earth will approach the Taurid swarm in 2019, best time after 1975 and before the 2030s; a H=24 body will reach m<21 in early to mid July with an on-sky motion of 10-20 deg/day
| 2019-05-06 | [The thermal, mechanical, structural, and dielectric properties of cometary nuclei after Rosetta](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.01156) | <strong>+ SSR review of Rosetta's finding at 67P, plus summary of all information known to this point </strong> <br> + Temperature -- following solar insulation; low thermal inertia means rapid temperature decrease with depth (hundreds K to tens K in the first meter) <br> + Thermal inertia -- <200 J/K/m^2/s^-0.5, thermal conductivitiy <0.009 W/m/K <br> Tensile and compressive strength - < 100 Pa <br> + Elastic properties -- 8-980 MPa (single site) but may vary greatly <br> + Surface roughness -- large variation at >10 m scale; not sure for <10 m scale; cm-dm scale pebbles <br> + Bulk density - 532+-7 kg/m^3 <br> + Dielectric properties -- permittivitity of subsurface layer -- 1.9-2.7 <br> + Porosity -- high, 70-80%
| 2019-05-07 | [On the Dynamics of Comets in Extrasolar Planetary Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06910) | + Dynamical investigation of three different exoplanet systems: HD 10180 -- tightly packed system -- comet can be captured or ejected depending on their initial orbits; 47 UMa -- inner rocky planets may be unable to get cometary water due to the presence of three gas giants; and HD 141399 -- four gas giants, similar situation as 47 UMa <br> + Looked at Tisserand parameter of simulated comets; no Jupiter-family-like comet family can be found in these systems due to multiple gas giants
| 2019-05-09 | [Kuiper belt: formation and evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02980) | <strong>+ Review of the accretion models of the Kuiper belt objects </strong> <br> + Old accretion model: KBOs are formed by progressive collisional coagulation of small sub-km planetesimals, with the origin of these sub-km bodies unexplained; howeverthe coagulation model cannot reproduce enough big, Pluto-sized objects in the primodial disk (failing by several magnitudes) <br> + Streaming instability has since been favoured -- collisional coagulation can produce objects up to a few hundreds of km and then streaming instability (gas drags of solid particles orbiting in a gas disk reading to clumps that can collapse into a big object); these processes occur over a few 1e4 yr; evidences supporting streaming instability: binaries of identical sizes, color ("failed" objects?) <br> + Giant planet instability (i.e. planet migration; Nice model) leads to sub-population of KBOs: hot/cold/resonant KBOs, scattered disk, and fossilized scattered disk <br> + Planetary migration leads to the production of Trojans and irregular satellites, which is predicted by dynamical models and supported by observational evidences; planetary migration is also responsible for the creation of the Oort cloud and the implantation of primitive asteroids in the main belt <br> + LSST's potential contribution: characterizing cold KBO region, find Neptunian Trojans, search for distant major planet, and characterize solar neighborhood
| 2019-05-14 | [ATM: An Open-Source Tool for Asteroid Thermal Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02908) | + Open-source asteroid thermal modeling code ([code on GitHub](https://github.com/moeyensj/atm)); shown are models created using WISE data; able to reproduce the original models produced by the WISE team
| 2019-05-14 | [Micrometeoroid Events in LISA Pathfinder](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02765) | + Presented an impact search using 4348 hours of LISA Pathfinder data -- found 54, momenta ranging from 0.2-230 uNs <br> + Cannot disentangle mass and velocity from momenta measurement alone; but from radiant distribution the authors concluded that these micrometeoroids are dominated by JFC particles
| 2019-05-15 | [The role of small telescopes as a ground-based support for exoplanetary space missions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06126) | + 2-m-class ground-based telescopes, equipped with high resolution spectrographs (with R=50000 or so; or radial velocity measurements), will be very important for next generation exoplanet search/characterization missions
| 2019-05-15 | [Lijiang 2.4-meter Telescope and its Instruments](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05915) | + LJT -- 2.4-m telescope at Lijiang, China's biggest multi-purpose optical telescope <br> + Current instruments are all at Cassegrain focus -- YFOSC (camera, low/mid dispersion spectrum), backup camera, HiRES/LiJET (at R=50000), CHILI (IFU)
| 2019-05-20 | [The Case for a Large-Scale Occultation Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06354) | + Proposed to build a network containing 2000 16" telescopes to monitor occultation of V<15 Gaia stars by Jupiter Trojans; rate: 7 occultations per Trojan per year; weather effect not modeled but argued that a large network should mitigate weather effects <br> + Will precisely measure the gravitational acceleration caused by Planet Nine (a simple estimate suggests that the perturbation caused by Planet Nine will lead to a motion at a level of 30 m by Trojans)
