| 2019-05-01 | [Oort cloud asteroids: Collisional evolution, the Nice Model, and the Grand Tack](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03199) | + Considered the Nice model, the Grand Tack, and migration-less scenario to see how many Oort cloud asteroids (i.e. Manx comet) should we see -- based on a single detection of such object (2014 S3) <br> + Background info: Grand Tack is something that happended in the first 5 Myr of the solar system, Nice model happened 500 Myr later; Grand Tack described migrations of gas giants in the very early age of solar system and provided initial condition for the Nice model (which described another set of migrations) <br> + Oort cloud asteroids can only be reproduced by the Grand Tack scenario (because only in that scenario, Jupiter migrated to 1.5 au and scattered hot asteroids into Oort cloud region?)
| 2019-05-01 | [A hypothesis for the rapid formation of planets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04451) | + Discussed production rates of interstellar objects (ISOs) during different stage of stellar/planetary system; formation stage of protoplanetary cloud can produce a large number of ISOs, followed by planetary migration and white dwarf expansion <br> + In particular, successive generations of star formations will accumulate ISOs in the galaxy, which could (as the authors hypothesized) accelerate formation of planets in next-generation planetary systems
| 2019-05-01 | [Terrestrial deuterium-to-hydrogen ratio in water in hyperactive comets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09175) | + Presented SOFIA/GREAT data of 46P/Wirtanen (509/547 GHz observation of HDO transition), showed that the D/H ratio is consistent with Earth's water <br> + Went on and showed that D/H and active fraction of the comet is correlated; more active comets have lower D/H; reach Earth's D/H when active fraction approaches 1 (me: could there be some sort of observational bias there? Or geophysical process on the comet?)
