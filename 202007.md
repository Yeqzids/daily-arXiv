Wendelstein imaging of comet 41P/Tuttle-Giacobini-Kresak during the 2017 perihelion arc](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03050) | + Broadband imaging of 41P using a 2-m telescope over 45 nights during its 2017 perihelion passage <br> + Analysis of dust activity is highly dependent on the choice of phase angle correction <br> + Gas modifies coma color and radial profile <br> + Evolving structures in the inner coma
| 2020-07-09 | [No evidence for interstellar planetesimals trapped in the Solar System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04534) | + Rebuttal to claims that retrograde coorbitals and high inclination Centaurs are trapped interstellar objects <br> <strong>+ Chaotic motion prevents tracing the source region of small bodies; backward and forward integration is statistically equivalent; thought experiment with aroma bottle</strong>; the common way is to start with an ansatz on the source and integrate it forward, then compare with the observed population + Copernician principle -- "we should not be living in a special moment of the history", but there are different interpretations; coorbitals and high inclination objects can be the surviving members of a larger primordial population (and now, a transient subset of a steady-state population)
| 2020-07-10 | [A Case study of light pollution in France after the change in legislation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04440) | + France enacted new law to restrict ourdoor lighting since 2019 Jan 1; light pollution decreased by 6% since then <br> + Locations suitable for Dark Sky parks may emerge in south France
| 2020-07-10 | [The Solar Eclipse of the Xia Dynasty: A Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04674) | + Review of the use of solar eclipses to determine the rise of the Xia Dynasty; new hypothesis suggesting a possible hybrid eclipse in 1903 BC, but uncertainties remain
| 2020-07-10 | [Photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy of comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner during its 2018 apparition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05017) | + Narrowband imaging and high-resolution spectrum of 21P during its 2018 apparition <br> + The spectrum at R=80,000 is able to resolve C, N isotopes (C12/13, N14/15) <br> + Dynamical simulation implies that 21P has been in the NEO region for 1650 yr, so likely a younger member in the JFC population, though hard to be definitive
| 2020-07-10 | [Physical characterization of 2020 AV2, the first known asteroid orbiting inside Venus orbit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08304) | + Optical-NIR spectroscopy suggests Sa type and an olivine-rich composition; 1 micron feature suggests a ferroan olivine minerology similar to brachinite meteorites
| 2020-07-10 | [Automation of the AST3 optical sky survey from Dome A, Antarctica](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08128) | + Description of the AST3 survey -- now consisists of two 50-cm Schmidt, AST3-1 (i-band only) and AST3-2 (R and i); AST3-3 is equiped with K-band filter and is yet to be deployed <br> + Clean air at Dome A leads to a redefinition of astronomical twilight from 18 deg to 13 deg <br> + Candidates and cutouts are transmitted back to NAOC in real-time (every 10 minutes)
| 2020-07-11 | [A Redistribution Tool for Long-Term Archive of Astronomical Observation Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09188) | + Spatial aggregation of image archive to make image query more efficient; useful for large observation archive; [AstroLayout code](https://gitee.com/AstroTJU/AstroLayout)

| 2020-07-11 | [Twenty years of PWV measurements in the Chajnantor Area](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04262) | + Cerro Chajnantor's PWV is 28% less than the plateau (1537 m height difference) <br> + 1.9% difference with just 27 m height different, possibly due to local topographic conditions <br> + No trend over the 20 years (1997-2017) that indicates climate change impact
| 2020-07-20 | [The Crucial Role of Ground- and Space-Based Remote Sensing Studies of Cometary Volatiles in the Next Decade (2023-2032)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08568) | + Previous decade of remote sensing cometary science: optical (especially narrowband: fragment species and isotopes), UV, sub-mm, NIR of trace volatiles <br> + Pressing questions for the next decade: inventory of coma condition and constraints of formation conditions, taxonomies to coma photochemistry, temporal varibility of coma compostion, asteroid-comet connection and interstellar objects <br> + Challenges: theoretical studies and lab studies, access to small (m-sized) and large (10-m-sized) telescopes, archives, big data
