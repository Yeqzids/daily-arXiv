| 2019-03-01 | [Synthesis of the Morphological Description of Cometary Dust at Comet 67P](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10634) | <strong> + Summary of dust measurements taken by Rosetta, comparison with previous missions and ground-based data </strong> <br> + Rosetta measurements confirmed the usefulness of dust tail/trail modeling of ground-based data <br> + Fig. 12 showed three groups of dust: porous (porosity 10-95%), fluffy (porosity >95%), and solid group, measured by Rosetta and previous missions; solid grains only exist for up to 0.5 mm or so, larger grains are all fluffy (up to 1 cm) and porous group

| 2019-03-06 | [The shape of (7) Iris as evidence of an ancient large impact?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09242) | + AO observations and shape modeling of Iris showed some 20-40 km features, which could be craters <br> + The lack of collisional family associated to Iris suggested that these impacts (if true) must happened long ago, e.g. 3 Gyr ago <br> + Derived density of Iris is 2.7 gcc, comparable to LL chondrite
| 2019-03-06 | [Solar cycle variation in meteor rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09422) | + Meteor rates between solar maximum and minimum can differ by 30%; geomagnetic activity effect accounts for <10%
| 2019-03-06 | [Gravitational waves from compact dark matter objects in the solar system](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08273) | + Argued that one can look for compact dark matter objects with LIGO and VIRGO data; calculated that no CDMO with 1e-9 solar mass (1e-3 Earth mass) exists inside the Sun (typo? Maybe inside Earth's orbit); authors plan to look for CDMOs inside Earth and Jupiter
| 2019-03-06 | [The Case for a Deep Search for Earth's Trojan Asteroids](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01922) | + Brief review of previous literatures; 16+-3 Earth Trojans with diameter over 160 m; importance in searching for Earth Trojans
| 2019-03-06 | [Site selection for the 3.4m optical telescope of the Iranian National Observatory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01785) | + 3-year survey over Iran for a 3.4-m optical telescope; identified Gargash (3600-m above MSL) as the candidate site, quoted a 2-year average seeing of 1.0"
