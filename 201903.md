Asteroids radiatively propelled by giant branch Yarkovsky effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02795) | + Studied Yarkovsky effects of asteroids in giant branch (i.e. very high luminosity stars) systems: Yarkovsky effects on these asteroids are much stronger than that of our solar system, and can lead to different end state of the eventual white dwarf stage <br> + Presence of big planets (considered one big planet in this work) further complicates the picture <br> + Asteroids can either be blown to 1e4-1e5 au, fall into the star, or locked in stable Kozai state; for <10 km asteroids, dynamical captures into resonances are insignificant
