| 2019-03-11 | [X-rays Studies of the Solar System](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02574) | <strong>+ Perspective of what X-ray astronomy can do to solar system objects</strong> <br> + Four directions: composition of comets through emissions, element composition of Europa, magnetospheric studies of planets, and atmosphere-solar X-ray interactions vs insights for exoplanets <br> + X-ray studies of comets are done by observing solar X-rays scattered from comets, and can be used to study solar wind, plasma interaction, and probe the neutral gas <br> + Current X-ray instruments are limited to study near-Earth comets and can only detect 0.5 comet per year <br> + Studies of planets and Jovian moons are seemingly mostly about characterizations

| 2019-03-14 | [Speeding past planets? Asteroids radiatively propelled by giant branch Yarkovsky effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.02795) | + Studied Yarkovsky effects of asteroids in giant branch (i.e. very high luminosity stars) systems: Yarkovsky effects on these asteroids are much stronger than that of our solar system, and can lead to different end state of the eventual white dwarf stage <br> + Presence of big planets (considered one big planet in this work) further complicates the picture <br> + Asteroids can either be blown to 1e4-1e5 au, fall into the star, or locked in stable Kozai state; for <10 km asteroids, dynamical captures into resonances are insignificant
| 2019-03-18 | [Planetary Bistatic Radar](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08712) | + Made a case for using ngVLA to study planetary objects -- Venus, asteroids, icy bodies, comets and interstellar objects

| 2019-03-21 | [Temperatures of lunar impact flashes: mass and size distribution of small impactors hitting the Moon](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.00987) | + Analyze lunar flashes detected by the NELIOTA project (a 1.2-m photospectroscopy telescope near Athens dedicated to the detection of lunar flashes) <br> + 55 events, multi-band colors allow the derivation of impact temperature; shows that the temperature varies between 1200 to 5800 K <br> + Also attempt to link flashes to showers, by considering the date/time of detection, and whether the shower radiant is above the lunar horizon at that time; this allows the authors to derive velocity/mass of the impactor <br> + Shows that these 9-10 mag flashes are produced by impactors of 10-100 g in mass, or a few cm in size
| 2019-03-21 | [An ancient and a primordial collisional family as the main sources of X-type asteroids of the inner Main Belt](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.01633) | + Suggests that the X-type near-Earth asteroids (NEAs), which the source remains unknown, are produced by an ancient collision in the inner main-belt about 3-4 Gyr ago <br> + This is done by a new method that examines the enhancement in a 2D space of semimajor axis and inverse asteroid size; argues that traditional orbital space method is not good, as the time would have erased signatures of ancient collisions; only examine asteroids larger than a certain size to ensure observational bias is removed
| 2019-03-21 | [Monitoring of the D Doublet of Neutral Sodium during Transits of Two "Evaporating" Planets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06217) | + Looking for sodium absorption of two Kepler planets that are very close to their host stars and should be evaporating, no >30% transit detected <br> + Multiple possible reasons of non-detection: narrow lines due to small thermal broadening of very hot planets are diluted (though, used here is the Subaru/HDS, R=45000), or the planets have run out of sodium <br> + Suggests that TESS will find more candidates for observation
| 2019-03-21 | [Do the Chinese Astronomical Records Dated AD 776 January 12/13 Describe an Auroral Display or a Lunar Halo? A Critical Re-examination](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06806) | + C14 record shows an increase of solar activity around 775 AD, but a Chinese record around 776 is controversial: could be aurora, or lunar halo <br> + Analyze the Chinese record under quantified criteria; support by counter-example to the lunar halo hypothesis
