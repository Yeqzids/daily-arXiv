| 2019-03-01 | [Synthesis of the Morphological Description of Cometary Dust at Comet 67P](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10634) | <strong> + Summary of dust measurements taken by Rosetta, comparison with previous missions and ground-based data </strong> <br> + Rosetta measurements confirmed the usefulness of dust tail/trail modeling of ground-based data <br> + Fig. 12 showed three groups of dust: porous (porosity 10-95%), fluffy (porosity >95%), and solid group, measured by Rosetta and previous missions; solid grains only exist for up to 0.5 mm or so, larger grains are all fluffy (up to 1 cm) and porous group

| 2019-03-06 | [The shape of (7) Iris as evidence of an ancient large impact?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09242) | + AO observations and shape modeling of Iris showed some 20-40 km features, which could be craters <br> + The lack of collisional family associated to Iris suggested that these impacts (if true) must happened long ago, e.g. 3 Gyr ago <br> + Derived density of Iris is 2.7 gcc, comparable to LL chondrite
| 2019-03-06 | [Solar cycle variation in meteor rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09422) | + Meteor rates between solar maximum and minimum can differ by 30%; geomagnetic activity effect accounts for <10%
| 2019-03-06 | [Gravitational waves from compact dark matter objects in the solar system](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08273) | + Argued that one can look for compact dark matter objects with LIGO and VIRGO data; calculated that no CDMO with 1e-9 solar mass (1e-3 Earth mass) exists inside the Sun (typo? Maybe inside Earth's orbit); authors plan to look for CDMOs inside Earth and Jupiter
| 2019-03-06 | [The Case for a Deep Search for Earth's Trojan Asteroids](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01922) | + Brief review of previous literatures; 16+-3 Earth Trojans with diameter over 160 m; importance in searching for Earth Trojans
| 2019-03-06 | [Site selection for the 3.4m optical telescope of the Iranian National Observatory](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01785) | + 3-year survey over Iran for a 3.4-m optical telescope; identified Gargash (3600-m above MSL) as the candidate site, quoted a 2-year average seeing of 1.0"
| 2019-03-06 | [C/2010 U3 (Boattini): A Bizarre Comet Active at Record Heliocentric Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02260) | + 2010 U3 was active at a recording distance of 25.8 au (beating 2017 K2 by a small margin); last visit 2 Myr ago <br> + K2 and U3 shows some difference -- diversity in comets active at very large heliocentric distances?
| 2019-03-07 | [Cometary topography and phase darkening](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06250) | + Short paper, presented a model that calculates the phase darkening from a variety types of topographies <br> + Compared to observations; determined that topography (geometric effect and evolved surface) can account for 37% of phase darkening effect
| 2019-03-07 | [Evaluation of filtering techniques to increase the reliability of meteo forecasts for ground-based telescopes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07974) | + Feeding surface data into the mesoscale models to select models likely to give good results <br> + A future direction is to use neural network to train the model so that it will know which parameter sets give better results (but authors stated that currently high computational cost prevents implementation into product)
| 2019-03-07 | [Towards the forecast of atmospheric parameters and optical turbulence above an astronomical site on 24h time scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07977) | + 4-domain, 0.1-km resolution mesoscale model operating at TNG for 24-h predictions
| 2019-03-07 | [4MOST: Project overview and information for the First Call for Proposals](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02464) | + 4MOST is a multi-object spectroscopic telescope converted from the former 4-m VISTA telescope; it operates on visible wavelength (350 to 950 nm) and has two resolutions: R=6500 and R=20000 (the latter only goes to 700 nm) <br> + The consortium runs a number of surveys; 50% are milky way surveys and the rest are extragalactic (including one time-domain survey), LMC/SMC and cosmological red-shifts <br> + Total survey field is 21000 deg^2 (largely the entire southern celestial sphere), each field has 2 hour total integration time and reach r=22.5
| 2019-03-07 | [4MOST Survey Strategy Plan](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02466) | + Same basic information as the above paper but mentioned that certain selected fields will have longer exposure; LSST deep drilling fields will have 60 hours of integration time, reaching G=24
