| 2024-03-02 | [Dynamics and potential origins of decimeter-sized particles around comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18613) | + Studied decimeter-class particles observed by Rosetta/OSIRIS at 67P <br> + Particles mostly originated from the Khonsu-Atum-Anubis area, i.e. not over the globe, and have an initial speed of 0.5-0.6 m/s <br> + Ejection cannot by explained by water ice sublimation and favorable illumination alone; likely due to CO2 ice sublimation and local structures of the source region; ejection speed is also quite high, so quite energetic rather than gradual liftoffs |
