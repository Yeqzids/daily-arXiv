| 2022-03-09 | [Thermal processing of Jupiter Family Comets during their chaotic orbital evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06685) | <strong>+ Apply thermal evolution model to Nesvorny's JFC orbit model (which reproduced JFC orbital distribution)</strong> <br> + All simulated JFCs are heated multiple times, processed layers up to 4100 m for sublimation of hypervolatiles, 125 m for sublimation of moderately active volatiles, and 27 m for crystallization of amorphous ice, so in short, all of them are baked through <br> <strong>+ Strongly suggest that hypervolatiles are all lost despite the limited extent of the simulation because the heating effect is so strong</strong>, going to JFCs for cryogenic material is a bad idea |
