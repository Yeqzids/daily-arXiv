| 2020-08-04 | [Cometary Plasma Science -- A White Paper in response to the Voyage 2050 Call by the European Space Agency](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00377) | + <strong>Review of cometary plasma science -- state of field and what is still missing <br> + Cometary plasma types: light solar wind ions, and heavy ions produced by the ionisation of the neutral gas produced by the comet; they can interact with each other which lead to the modification of both, a process called the mass-loading; activity can be divided into three levels by 5e26 and 5e27 <br> + Active comets can form bow shocks, solar wind ion cavity and diamagnetic cavity, all related to mass-loading, (many?) comets have plasma tails; plasma tails can disconnect or change shapes due to environmental solar wind conditions, such as shock wave, magnetic field inversion, or increasing dynamic pressure; cometary plasma can also interact with neutral coma and dust (the latter is especially poorly understood) <br> + Unknowns </strong>
| 2020-08-25 | [Thirteen years of Weather Statistics at San Pedro Martir Observatory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02402) | + Climatological statistics (wind, temperature, humidity only) at San Petro Martir/SPM Observatory; driest in spring and most humid in summer, with an annual precipitation of 300 mm; <br> + Introduction mentioned a clear fraction of 70-80% with mean seeing at 0.8" |
| 2020-08-25 | [Synergies between ground-based and space-based observations in the solar system and beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01080) | + White paper: importance of ground supporting observations of space missions <br> + Venus: IR and submm ranges are populated with strong spectral features that can be used to understand dynamics and evolution of the atmosphere <br> + Mars: ground observations (e.g. active radar observations such as the 3-km resolution Arecibo observation) provide spatial and temporal context to interpret and extrapolate in-situ observations <br> + Titan (as well as Jupiter): ALMA global snapshot imaginary; ground-based submm/mm observations are crucial for continuing Cassini's legacy and form a more complete understanding of the chemical and climatological variation on Titan over the entire Titan year <br> Comets and other small bodies: ground observations help put spacecraft targets in the context of the wider population of small bodies, and provide temperal context of the behavior and evolution of targets; astrometry and light-curve provide constraints on the rotational state and orbit of the target, and radar and spectroscopy provide further characterization <br> + Recommendation: strategic planning involving mission personnels; consider and prioritize simultaneous multi-observatory observations |
