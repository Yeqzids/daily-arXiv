| 2020-03-09 | [On the orbital evolution of 2020 AV2, the first asteroid ever observed to go around the Sun inside the orbit of Venus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03033) | + Vatiras can have different dynamical configurations -- 3:2 MMR with Venus, 29:1 with Jupiter, and 29:12 with Earth <br> + 2020 AV2 probably belong to none of these classes and do not subject to Kozai resonance
| 2020-03-12 | [On the Impact of Satellite Constellations on Astronomical Observations with ESO telescopes in the Visible and Infrared Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01992) | + Considered all large future networks -- over 26,000 sats <br> + Impact is mostly limited to twilight hours, where 260 sats <br> + Impact to regular observation is within 1% level; largest impact on wide-field survey operating in twilight hours, as much as 30-40% of images can be affected
| 2020-03-18| [Investigating Taxonomic Diversity within Asteroid Families through ATLAS Dual-Band Photometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08135) | + Using ATLAS c- and o-band photometry to classify asteroid families; c-band is g plus half r; o-band is half r plus i <br> + These ATLAS ultra-broadband data is sufficient to classify C/S asteroids down to H=15 in the main-belt <br> + Accounted for possible color changes due to rotation (authors have determined rotation period before classification)
| 2020-03-18 | [Fragmentation modelling of the August 2019 impact on Jupiter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07894) | + A 5-mag impact flash on Jupiter on 2019 Aug 7; impactor is 4-10 m in size (but the authors used Brown's Earth bolide equation to derive this number); used a fragmentation model to fit the light-curve, with no clear answer to the property of the impactor
| 2020-03-18 | [The Solar wind prevents re-accretion of debris after Mercury's giant impact](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07847) | + Strong solar wind from the younger sun will remove any sub-m debris produced by a giant impact (with an impactor of 3000-6000 km in size) from Mercury's orbit in sub-Myr timescale
| 2020-03-18 | [Hubble Space Telescope Search for Activity in High Perihelion Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06519) | + HST observation of 53 high-perihelion objects (q>15 au), none are active, consistent with crystallization trigger hypothesis, but mass loss can also be driven by supervolatiles <br> + Also searched for binaries, finding none, establishing a 3-sigma limit of <8%
| 2020-03-18 | [Cryogenic-specific reddish coloration by cryoplasma: New explanation to color diversity of outer solar system objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07447) | + Lab experiments demonstrated the reddish color in cryo temperature can be produced by methanol- and water-containing ice irradiated with nitrogen-containing cryoplasma at 85K, and such color faded away at 120-150 K when the ice are heated, providing a possible explanation of the ultra-red objects in the outer solar system
| 2020-03-31 | [On the orbital evolution of meteoroid 2020 CD3, a temporarily-captured orbiter of the Earth-Moon system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.09220) | + Dynamical investigation of 2020 CD3; captured in 2016(+2)(-4), and will depart in early May <br> + Arjuna asteroid/meteoroid: a secondary asteroid belt that share the orbit with the Earth due to resonance
| 2020-03-31 | [A new method for measuring the meteor mass index: application to the 2018 Draconid meteor shower outburst](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03881) | + A new method for measuring meteor mass index based on maximum likelihood estimation; used the gamma distribution of MLE in scipy

| 2020-03-31 | [Enceladus Farm: Can plants grow with Enceladus' water? (Preliminary Report)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.14131) |  + Produced salt water consistent with the observation of the water on Enceladus and used them to grow plants; plants can grow if they are placed in pure water until they have a few leaves
