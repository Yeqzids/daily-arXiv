| 2019-10-08 | [Kruger 60 -- a plausible home system of the interstellar comet C/2019 Q4](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10952) | Tracing 2I backward using current data; no nongrav considered; close encounter with Kruger 60, miss distance 1.74 pc with relative velocity of 3.43 km/s
| 2019-10-21 | [Are 2I/Borisov and Oort Cloud Comets Alike?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08208) | + Analyze brightening light-curve, dust size, conclude that 2I is similar to Oort-cloud comets
| 2019-10-23 | [Physical Characterization of the December 2017 Outburst of the Centaur 174P/Echeclus](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09490) | + Outburst of 174P in 2017 <br> + 174P entered its current orbit around 1144 AD <br> + Assuming 174P is a typical Centaur, other Centaurs will have a few 1-mag level outbursts every year 
| 2019-10-23 | [New Insights into Interstellar Object 1I/2017 U1 (\`Oumuamua) from SOHO/STEREO Nondetections](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10303) | + SOHO/STEREO nondetection of \`Oumuamua at 0.375 au yield tighter dust loss/water rate <br> + \`Oumuamua might still be weakly active in the SOHO/STEREO field and could have different properties compared to average solar system comets
| 2019-10-29 | [Note on the HST Image of Comet 2I/Borisov Taken on 2019 October 12](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11457) | + Noted the large cm-sized dust likely released at 10 AU
| 2019-10-29 | [Palomar Gattini-IR: Survey overview, data processing system, on-sky performance and first results](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13319) | + Gattini-IR: 2-day cadence, 15000 deg^2 survey to 15.7 AB mag, with the goal being probing the reddest/dustiest transients in the local universe
| 2019-10-29 | [Detection of CN gas in Interstellar Object 2I/Borisov](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12144) | + Detection of CN gas on 2I, measurement of dust; showed that the characteristics of 2I is compatible to typical solar system comets
