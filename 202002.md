| 2020-02-04 | [Developing a Cost-Effective Radiometer for Fireball Light Curves](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12807) | + Developing a prototype of a cheap (<100 Euros) radiometer that detects fireball using their emission at 777 nm; can work during cloudy nights as this emission penetrates clouds <br> + Design to detect fireballs brighter than about -4 mag
| 2020-02-04 | [Macroscopic Dark Matter Constraints from Bolide Camera Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00557) | + Current fireball networks (DFN as an example) can detect macroscopic dark matter (macros) up to 1e9 g in mass; more massive macros will be too large to appear as typical fireballs
| 2020-02-04 | [Spectral and orbital survey of medium-sized meteoroids](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01565) | + Spectral and orbital survey of meteors between -1 to -14 mag -- roughly mm to cm sizes <br> + Data based on the All-sky Meteor Orbit System (AMOS): 11 camera sub-networks and 5 spectroscopic systems with R=200, covering 370 to 900 nm <br> + Increasing Na/Mg ratio (more volatiles) and decreasing Fe content at larger sizes <br> + Confirmed depletion of Na among low-q streams, hence thermal desorption can lead to the loss of volatiles and increasing material strength; but Perseids and 49 Andromedids have high Na content and high strength <br> + Heterogeneity among several major cometary streams: Perseids, alpha-Capricornids, delta-Aquarids, but probably due to environmental factors and thermal history of the meteoroids rather than the parent comet <br> + Spectral similaritise between kappa-Cygnids and Taurids
| 2020-02-04 | [29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1, A Centaur in the Gateway to the Jupiter-Family Comets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04185) | + Used numerical simulation to identify a gateway region that is within 2 au outside Jupiter's orbit; particles in this region have about 75% chance of evolving into JFC-like orbits; particles spend about a kyr or two in this gateway region <br> + Currently there are four occupants in this region: 29P, 2010 TO20, 2008 CL94, 2016 LN8; 29P has 65% chance to become a JFC in the next 10 kyr
| 2020-02-06 | [Potential Backup Targets for Comet Interceptor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01744) | + Backup, short-period targets for Comet Interceptor, fly-by time 2031 to 2037; 2016 BA14, 7P, 8P, 15P, 21P, 26P, 73P, 189P, 289P and 300P
| 2020-02-06 | [Capturing Cosmic Ray Research and Researchers with Art](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09054) | + Seeking different way to explore cosmic ray science -- artist statement, bios
| 2020-02-06 | [The Sounds of Music : Science of Musical Scales II -- Western Classical](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06259) | + Connecting musical scales, tones, to simple Pythagoras ratios
| 2020-02-06 | [Enhancing Conference Participation to Bridge the Diversity Gap](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10996) | + Survey within STScI to figure out how to improve conference participation of women and minorities; recommendation: allow remote participation, diversify SOC and speaker list, increase travel funding and dependent care
| 2020-02-06 | [A TESS Search for Distant Solar System Objects: Yield Estimates](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03676) | + Digital tracking on TESS dataset can reach 22 mag at 50% completeness, but a random-walk orbital search require 1e16 mathematical operations (calculated from the product of all variables) <br> + Expected 800 new Centaurs/SDOs and 200 new KBOs from the search
