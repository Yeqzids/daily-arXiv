| 2020-02-04 | [Developing a Cost-Effective Radiometer for Fireball Light Curves](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12807) | + Developing a prototype of a cheap (<100 Euros) radiometer that detects fireball using their emission at 777 nm; can work during cloudy nights as this emission penetrates clouds <br> + Design to detect fireballs brighter than about -4 mag
| 2020-02-04 | [Macroscopic Dark Matter Constraints from Bolide Camera Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00557) | + Current fireball networks (DFN as an example) can detect macroscopic dark matter (macros) up to 1e9 g in mass; more massive macros will be too large to appear as typical fireballs
| 2020-02-04 | [Spectral and orbital survey of medium-sized meteoroids](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.01565) | + Spectral and orbital survey of meteors between -1 to -14 mag -- roughly mm to cm sizes <br> + Data based on the All-sky Meteor Orbit System (AMOS): 11 camera sub-networks and 5 spectroscopic systems with R=200, covering 370 to 900 nm <br> + Increasing Na/Mg ratio (more volatiles) and decreasing Fe content at larger sizes <br> + Confirmed depletion of Na among low-q streams, hence thermal desorption can lead to the loss of volatiles and increasing material strength; but Perseids and 49 Andromedids have high Na content and high strength <br> + Heterogeneity among several major cometary streams: Perseids, alpha-Capricornids, delta-Aquarids, but probably due to environmental factors and thermal history of the meteoroids rather than the parent comet <br> + Spectral similaritise between kappa-Cygnids and Taurids
| 2020-02-04 | [29P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 1, A Centaur in the Gateway to the Jupiter-Family Comets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04185) | + Used numerical simulation to identify a gateway region that is within 2 au outside Jupiter's orbit; particles in this region have about 75% chance of evolving into JFC-like orbits; particles spend about a kyr or two in this gateway region <br> + Currently there are four occupants in this region: 29P, 2010 TO20, 2008 CL94, 2016 LN8; 29P has 65% chance to become a JFC in the next 10 kyr

| 2020-02-04 | [Cometary Plasma Science -- A White Paper in response to the Voyage 2050 Call by the European Space Agency](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00377) | + <strong>Review of cometary plasma science -- state of field and what is still missing <br> + Cometary plasma types: light solar wind ions, and heavy ions produced by the ionisation of the neutral gas produced by the comet; they can interact with each other which lead to the modification of both, a process called the mass-loading; activity can be divided into three levels by 5e26 and 5e27 <br> + Active comets can form bow shocks, solar wind ion cavity and diamagnetic cavity, all related to mass-loading, (many?) comets have plasma tails; plasma tails can disconnect or change shapes due to environmental solar wind conditions, such as shock wave, magnetic field inversion, or increasing dynamic pressure; cometary plasma can also interact with neutral coma and dust (the latter is especially poorly understood) <br> + Unknowns </strong>
