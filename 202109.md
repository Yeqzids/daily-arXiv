| 2021-09-01 | [Orbit determination just from historical observations? Test case: The comet of AD 760 is identified as 1P/Halley](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07241) | + Resynthesize comet observations from China, Syria and West Asia sources with "critical close reading" of the original text to test the idea of deriving high quality orbits from historical observations alone <br> + Include uncertainty ranges to facilitate a brute-force orbit solving <br> + Showed that good orbit can be derived, with uncertainty in q of 0.02 au and T of 1.7 days <br> + Also examined brightness of the comet <br> + Will apply this technique to other comet sightings in history |
| 2021-09-01 | [Exploring the Solar System with the NOIRLab Source Catalog I: Detecting Objects with CANFind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00088) | + Algorithm and test to search for SSOs in NOIRLab Source Catalog DR1 (comprises of sources detected on large survey telescopes/projects, such as DECam, Bok 90) <br> + Uses DBSCAN and RANSAC algorithm provided by scikit-learn to reject stationary objects and look for linearly moving objects <br> + [Code](https://github.com/katiefasbender/CANFind) |
| 2021-09-01 | [Critical spin periods of sub-km-sized cohesive rubble-pile asteroids: dependencies on material parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12605) | + Exploration of material dependencies on what and when sub-km-sized rubble-piles break up; somewhat strong dependence on shape |
| 2021-09-01 | [Machine Learning for Searching the Dark Energy Survey for Trans-Neptunian Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12856) | + Test efficiencies of various ML algorithm on simulated DECam data to see which is best for the search of TNOs; found Random Forest is the best <br> + Doesn't seem to have discussed possible bias in the detection part, maybe I missed it? |
| 2021-09-01 | [Thermophysical model for icy cometary dust particles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13208) | + A thermophysical model in DSMC to model the behavior of icy cometary dust particles after they are ejected from the nucleus <br> + A mm-sized particle with 5% ice will disrupt within minutes at 1.35 au due to internal pressure build-up; cm-sized (or larger) particles appear to be insensitive to ice/dust content and therefore may be able to sustain sublimation |
| 2021-09-02 | [Investigating the Relationship between (3200) Phaethon and (155140) 2005 UD through Telescopic and Laboratory Studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01020) | + First NIR spectrum of 2005 UD shows that it is different from Phaethon -- not blue, just reddish <br> + Hypothesized that different thermal history might lead to difference between fragmentation daughters, but laboratory experiment rejected <br> + Conclude that Phaethon and 2005 UD are likely just chance alignment <br> + Possible scenarios of Phaethon/Geminid formation: interloper from outer solar system through the main-belt, or that Phaethon's orbit has been changed during Geminid formation so that numerical simulation cannot reveal its dynamical history |
| 2021-09-02 | [The Development and Scientific Application of the Dragonfly Telephoto Array](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00686) | + Jielai Zhang's thesis about Dragonfly; techniques to model and subtract sky background to make it to 30 mag/arcsec^2 |
