| 2021-09-01 | [Orbit determination just from historical observations? Test case: The comet of AD 760 is identified as 1P/Halley](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07241) | + Resynthesize comet observations from China, Syria and West Asia sources with "critical close reading" of the original text to test the idea of deriving high quality orbits from historical observations alone <br> + Include uncertainty ranges to facilitate a brute-force orbit solving <br> + Showed that good orbit can be derived, with uncertainty in q of 0.02 au and T of 1.7 days <br> + Also examined brightness of the comet <br> + Will apply this technique to other comet sightings in history |
