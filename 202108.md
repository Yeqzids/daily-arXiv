A comparison of anomaly detection algorithms for time-domain astronomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06760) | + Review of different algorithms to detect objects of interest in time-domain dataset <br> + Good idea to use multiple algorithm (tree-based and manifold learning) to find objects as this will not only ensure interesting things got covered, but will also identify candidates that share multiple characteristics |
