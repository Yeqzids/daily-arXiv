| 2019-07-01 | [Disintegration of Active Asteroid P/2016 G1 (PANSTARRS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00751) | + Compilation of PS1, CFHT and HCT data of P/2016 G1, showed a disintegration over about 4 months featuring a ring of large particles <br> + Proposed that the activity was caused by an impact of a small object (m-sized?) on a larger parent (100-m-sized?), and the ring was formed by dust ejecta during a crater forming process
| 2019-07-03 | [Fragmented Comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01737) | + Analysis of HST data taken during 73P's 2006 apparition, found a long rotation period (10 h) much longer than critical spin period; also found very small dust size (3 micron) <br> + Dust size was inferred from dust outflow speed, which was in turn inferred by the phase lag of coma measured by different aperture sizes <br> + Nucleus radius is 400+-100 m
| 2019-07-03 | [Astro2020 APC White Paper: The Early Career Perspective on the Coming Decade, Astrophysics Career Paths, and the Decadal Survey Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01676) | + Identified important topics for early career astronomers in the 2020s, made recommendations for policy makers <br> + Themes: big data and data science, large missions and collaborations, career preparations from departments, how to better support postdocs, diversities
