| 2019-07-01 | [Disintegration of Active Asteroid P/2016 G1 (PANSTARRS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00751) | + Compilation of PS1, CFHT and HCT data of P/2016 G1, showed a disintegration over about 4 months featuring a ring of large particles <br> + Proposed that the activity was caused by an impact of a small object (m-sized?) on a larger parent (100-m-sized?), and the ring was formed by dust ejecta during a crater forming process
