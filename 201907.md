| 2019-07-01 | [Disintegration of Active Asteroid P/2016 G1 (PANSTARRS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00751) | + Compilation of PS1, CFHT and HCT data of P/2016 G1, showed a disintegration over about 4 months featuring a ring of large particles <br> + Proposed that the activity was caused by an impact of a small object (m-sized?) on a larger parent (100-m-sized?), and the ring was formed by dust ejecta during a crater forming process
| 2019-07-03 | [Fragmented Comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01737) | + Analysis of HST data taken during 73P's 2006 apparition, found a long rotation period (10 h) much longer than critical spin period; also found very small dust size (3 micron) <br> + Dust size was inferred from dust outflow speed, which was in turn inferred by the phase lag of coma measured by different aperture sizes <br> + Nucleus radius is 400+-100 m

| 2019-07-10 | [Orbital stability in the Solar System for arbitrary inclinations and eccentricities: planetary perturbations versus resonances](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05870) | + A map of dynamically stable niches in the solar system: objects with very high eccentricities can survived in certain parts in the solar system, all these are mostly because mean motion resonances <br> + Existence of a stable strip with i around 150 deg; unstable regions between 10-30 au; stable strips of high eccentricity objects between the Hildas and Jupiter <br> + Note that the map (e.g. Fig. 8) also shows that IEOs also tend to be very stable
| 2019-07-10 | [Thermal properties of slowly rotating asteroids: Results from a targeted survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06056) | + A targeted survey of slowly rotating large (30-150 km) main-belters, aim to derive their thermal properties and verify earlier suggestion that slow rotators tend to have higher thermal inertia <br> + Presented results for 16 slow rotators, large scatter (between 3-45 J/m^2/s^0.5/K); cannot confirm the earlier hypothesis
| 2019-07-10 | [Thermophysical modeling of NEOWISE observations of DESTINY+ targets Phaethon and 2005 UD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04518) | + Modeling of Phaethon and 2005 UD using NEOWISE data: Phaethon -- D=4.6 km, p_v=0.16, Gamma=900 J/m^2/s^0.5/K; 2005 UD -- D=1.2 km, p_v=0.14 <br> + Difference between Phaethon's sizes derived from IR and radar is >3 sigma
| 2019-07-11 | [A common origin for dynamically associated near-Earth asteroid pairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12058) | + A search of recently-formed pairs in the NEA population: found two: 2015 EE7 -- 2015 FP124, and 2017 SN16 -- 2018 RY7; both pairs share similar taxonomy <br> + The SN16--RY7 pair is likely <10 kyr old, the EE7--FP124 not sure due to poor orbits <br> + My note: one of the components seems to have less accurate orbit -- RY7 has U=4, FP124 has U=8!
| 2019-07-11 | [The Hamburg Meteorite Fall: Fireball trajectory, orbit and dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03008) | + Analysis of the Hamburg meteorite fall in Jan 2018 near Ann Arbor; H4 chondrite (H chondrite is a common species); the 14th H condrite with orbit <br> + Data: 27 casual video footage (most meteor cameras were clouded out), lightning detector on GOES-16, infrasound, weather radar <br> + 2-7 t TNT energy release; 0.3 to 0.5 m parent body, entry speed 15.83 +- 0.05 km/s <br> + Orbit is solved using a new program developed by Vida (paper in review)
