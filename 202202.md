Identifying asteroid trails in Hubble Space Telescope images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00246) | + Zooniverse project + [Google Cloud AutoML Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision/automl/object-detection/docs) (a deep learning algorithm) to identify asteroid trails in HST images <br> + Rely on Zooniverse volunteers to mark the beginning/end of the trail; no good estimates on completeness |

Roman account for possible sighting of this comet <br> + Hypothesized neck and lobes of the parent could become sub-families |
