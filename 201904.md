| 2019-04-02 | [Orbital clustering in the distant solar system](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07115) | + Reinforced their argument that Planet Nine is responsible for the orbital clustering of distant KBOs; argued that the OSSOS work assumed a general uniform distribution for the whereabout of Planet Nine, causing a lower-than-usual statistical significance
| 2019-04-02 | [Opportunities for Astrophysical Science from the Inner and Outer Solar System](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05729) | + Astrophysical science enable by interplanetary/interstellar probes <br> + Planetary sciences: probing the dust cloud in the Solar System (outside Earth's orbit), Earth imaging -- providing context for second Earths; astrophysics: extragalactic background light (outside Jupiter's orbit), transient follow-up, microlensing (though the latter two can just be conducted on regular space missions) <br> + Advocating a 50-year/1000 au mission
| 2019-04-02  | [Hot exozodiacal dust: an exocometary origin?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06130) | + Tried to use numerical simulations to explain hot exozodiacal dust clouds -- visible at JHK band (with no/weak MIR signals) and 1000 times brighter than the one in our Solar System <br> + Found that Poynting-Robert spiral cannot explain the observed hot exozodis -- cannot reproduce null-weak MIR signal <br> + The exocometary delivery provided a better match to the observations: mainly the bright NIR signal and little/no MIR signal; this requires certain exocomet influx though
| 2019-04-02 | [Spectroscopic and dynamical properties of comet C/2018 F4, likely a true average former member of the Oort cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10838) | + GTC observation of C/2018 F4: imaging, visible spectroscopy; coupled with dynamical analysis, the authors concluded that it is a dynamically old Oort cloud comet
| 2019-04-04 | [Evidence against non-gravitational acceleration of 1I/2017 U1 'Oumuamua](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02218) | + Argued that 'Oumuamua's non-gravitational acceleration is questionable because physically it is difficult, and the non-gravitational parameter cannot simultaneously reduce the O-C error (why not?)
| 2019-04-04 | [Astro2020 Science White Paper: The Next Decade of Astroinformatics and Astrostatistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06796) | + Advocating more funding, positions and infrastructure to interdisciplinary research in astroinformatics and astrostatistics <br> + Tabulated (in Table 2) several themes that require astroinformatics and astrostatics -- exoplanet survey and statistics, stellar astronomy, multi-messenger astrophysics, cosmology
| 2019-04-04 | [A Taxonomic Study of Asteroid Families from KMTNet-SAAO Multi-band Photometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08019) | + VRI photometry of 2000 main-belt asteroids and peek into color dependencies of asteroid families, covered 9 of the 69 known families (with 20 members or more measured) <br> + Showed which of them are likely have the same origin (judging from colors)
| 2019-04-04 | [First Results from the rapid-response spectrophotometric characterization of Near-Earth Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08320) | + Rapid response broadband (ri) measurements of 82 NEOs, focused on small (<850 m) NEOs <br> + Showed that the C:S ratio of <80 NEOs is roughly 1:1; 10% NEOs measured are neither C nor S
| 2019-04-04 | [Astro2020 Science White Paper: Triggered High-Priority Observations of Dynamic Solar System Phenomena](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08753) | + Advocated long-term programs on next generation large/space telescopes on dynamic solar system phenomena -- mentioned atmospheric features on giants (storms, impacts, responses to corona mass ejections), time-domain features on ocean words and Io, active asteroids and interstellar objects
| 2019-04-05 | [The future of stellar occultations by distant solar system bodies: perspectives from the Gaia astrometry and the deep sky surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00723) | + Gaia and LSST will provide better astrometry baseline which will benefit KBO occultation, need to have good network(s) of small telescopes, quick readout detectors, and big data approach to make use of it
| 2019-04-05 | [Exploring the composition of icy bodies at the fringes of the Solar System with next generation space telescopes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07691) | + Spectral information of icy moons and medium-sized KBOs is useful to push the knowledge of outer Solar System to the next level; next generation space telescopes (8-15 m sized) need to be prepared for these targets
| 2019-04-05 | [Meteoroid Structure and Fragmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06572) | <strong>+ Structure and fragmentation of meteoroids probed by intereferometric radar, high resolution optical system, and modeling</strong> <br> + Direct evidence -- fragmentation; indirect evidence -- begin and end heights, lightcurves, spectra <br> + Large asteroidal meteoroids are stronger than rubble piles but weaker than recovered meteorites, while smaller meteoroids are very weakly bounded grains; large inhomogeneity (scatter of properties) of particles from the same parent body <br> + Near-Sun meteoroids are interesting; some small near-Sun meteoroids show a distinct lack of sodium which may be linked to thermal process; size distribution of streams rich in fragile meteoroids is also of interest; inhomogeneity may point to difference in formation process of parents
| 2019-04-08 | [Kuiper Belt-Like Hot and Cold Populations of Planetesimal Inclinations in the β Pictoris Belt Revealed by ALMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04081) | + Probing an edge-on protoplanetary disk β Pic, finds that it is best described by two Gaussian functions, implying two populations of planetesimals? <br> + If true, providing information about formation mechanism -- either hot/cold population, or presence of planets
| 2019-04-08 | [An introduction to a new space debris evolution model -- SOLEM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11762) | + Chinese space debris evolution model <br> + Currently applicable to space debris between 200-2000 km; will extend to GEO in future
