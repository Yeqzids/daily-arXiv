| 2019-04-02  | [Hot exozodiacal dust: an exocometary origin?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06130) | + Tried to use numerical simulations to explain hot exozodiacal dust clouds -- visible at JHK band (with no/weak MIR signals) and 1000 times brighter than the one in our Solar System <br> + Found that Poynting-Robert spiral cannot explain the observed hot exozodis -- cannot reproduce null-weak MIR signal <br> + The exocometary delivery provided a better match to the observations: mainly the bright NIR signal and little/no MIR signal; this requires certain exocomet influx though
| 2019-04-02 | [Spectroscopic and dynamical properties of comet C/2018 F4, likely a true average former member of the Oort cloud](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10838) | + GTC observation of C/2018 F4: imaging, visible spectroscopy; coupled with dynamical analysis, the authors concluded that it is a dynamically old Oort cloud comet
| 2019-04-04 | [Evidence against non-gravitational acceleration of 1I/2017 U1 'Oumuamua](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02218) | + Argued that 'Oumuamua's non-gravitational acceleration is questionable because physically it is difficult, and the non-gravitational parameter cannot simultaneously reduce the O-C error (why not?)
| 2019-04-04 | [Astro2020 Science White Paper: The Next Decade of Astroinformatics and Astrostatistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06796) | + Advocating more funding, positions and infrastructure to interdisciplinary research in astroinformatics and astrostatistics <br> + Tabulated (in Table 2) several themes that require astroinformatics and astrostatics -- exoplanet survey and statistics, stellar astronomy, multi-messenger astrophysics, cosmology

| 2019-04-04 | [First Results from the rapid-response spectrophotometric characterization of Near-Earth Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08320) | + Rapid response broadband (ri) measurements of 82 NEOs, focused on small (<850 m) NEOs <br> + Showed that the C:S ratio of <80 NEOs is roughly 1:1; 10% NEOs measured are neither C nor S
| 2019-04-04 | [Astro2020 Science White Paper: Triggered High-Priority Observations of Dynamic Solar System Phenomena](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08753) | + Advocated long-term programs on next generation large/space telescopes on dynamic solar system phenomena -- mentioned atmospheric features on giants (storms, impacts, responses to corona mass ejections), time-domain features on ocean words and Io, active asteroids and interstellar objects
| 2019-04-05 | [The future of stellar occultations by distant solar system bodies: perspectives from the Gaia astrometry and the deep sky surveys](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00723) | + Gaia and LSST will provide better astrometry baseline which will benefit KBO occultation, need to have good network(s) of small telescopes, quick readout detectors, and big data approach to make use of it
| 2019-04-05 | [Exploring the composition of icy bodies at the fringes of the Solar System with next generation space telescopes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07691) | + Spectral information of icy moons and medium-sized KBOs is useful to push the knowledge of outer Solar System to the next level; next generation space telescopes (8-15 m sized) need to be prepared for these targets
| 2019-04-05 | [Meteoroid Structure and Fragmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06572) | <strong>+ Structure and fragmentation of meteoroids probed by intereferometric radar, high resolution optical system, and modeling</strong> <br> + Direct evidence -- fragmentation; indirect evidence -- begin and end heights, lightcurves, spectra <br> + Large asteroidal meteoroids are stronger than rubble piles but weaker than recovered meteorites, while smaller meteoroids are very weakly bounded grains; large inhomogeneity (scatter of properties) of particles from the same parent body <br> + Near-Sun meteoroids are interesting; some small near-Sun meteoroids show a distinct lack of sodium which may be linked to thermal process; size distribution of streams rich in fragile meteoroids is also of interest; inhomogeneity may point to difference in formation process of parents

| 2019-04-08 | [The Spin-Barrier Ratio for S and C-Type Main Asteroids Belt](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11876) | + Tried to see if C/S population of 4-20 km diameter asteroids has noticeable difference of spin limit <br> + No obvious difference found  (slightly more C, at 2 sigma level) but probably due to the small statistics (a total of 774 asteroids in the size range with measured lightcurve and taxonomy)
| 2019-04-09 | [The consequences of planetary migration on the minor bodies of the early Solar System](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04591) | + Studied the impact of planetary migration to Jupiter Trojans and Hildas <br> + Planetary migration as we know it (and as the authors modeled) can explain the relative depletion of Hildas and the assymetry of Trojan swarms (a more populated leading group) <br> + Authors' model predicts near-zero inclination and 1000-10000x more Trojans -- need more work to explore why

| 2019-04-09 | [A transiting exocomet detected in broadband light by TESS in the β Pictoris system](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11071) | + First transiting exocomet found by TESS in the β Pic system <br> + Three events over a 105-day period; depths from 0.5-2 mmag, longest one about 2 days; assymetric behavior consistent with sublimating comet transitting the star disk <br> <strong>+ Simple model simulating the transit depth caused by an optically thin comet</strong> <br> <strong>+ MCMC fit around the transit feature to obtain uncertainty using Python's emcee package</strong>
| 2019-04-10 | [The environmental effects of very large bolide impacts on early Mars explored with a hierarchy of numerical models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07666) | + Use a combination of climate, radiative and mantle models to explore the effect of asteroid impact (100 km sized impactor) <br> + Such impact can create a warm period of a few decades and large precipitation (2.6 m of precipitation globally per Earth year) <br> + Such impact can produce thermal anomaly in the mantle for 1e7 yr <br> + However the behavior of Noachian valley networks is inconsistent with an impact-induced flooding, therefore impact is unlikely not the direct cause of the formation of the valleys
| 2019-04-10 | [Constraining the Thermal Properties of Planetary Surfaces using Machine Learning: Application to Airless Bodies](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08631) | + Presented a machine-learned model for predicting thermal properties based on emitted IR flux, trained on simulated data <br> + Properties are simulated using different input of regolith/rock properties; relations between ML-predicted properties and observed quantities are established using MCMC
