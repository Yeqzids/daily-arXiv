| 2022-12-18 | [Dark Comets? Unexpectedly Large Nongravitational Accelerations on a Sample of Small Asteroids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08115) | + Statistically significant non-gravitational acceletation found in a couple of small asteroids <br> + Dust emission on the order of 1e-4 g/s, undetectable in photometric data (only 0.0025% in brightness) |
| 2022-12-28 | [Dynamical Population of Comet Reservoirs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00010) | + Numerical perspective/review on how gas giant migration and Sun's formation location in the Milky Way can change the two comet reservoirs <br> + Less than 1 percent of what was in the primordial scattered disk were captured into the modern TNO population, and even less remain in the modern scattered disk; up to about 5 percent of dispersed objects are captured into the Oort cloud <br> + Number of modelled LPC from Oort cloud is still 50-1000x larger than the observed, but can be due to the large uncertainty in converting cometary magnitude to nuclear size <br> + Formation environment of the Solar nebula and interaction with nearby stars shapes the extent and structure of the Oort cloud <br> + LSST and future occultation observation will help uncerstand TNOs; Oort cloud may require space mission |
