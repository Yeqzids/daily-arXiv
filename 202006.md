| 2020-06-22 | [Counterparts of Far Eastern Guest Stars: Novae,supernovae, or something else?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00977) | + Fifth and last paper in a series of papers that develop new standard method in developing method of analyzing historic observations by comparing against modern catalogs; comparing Far Eastern Guest Stars with modern nebula and other supernova remnant catalogs <br> + List of difficulties and open questions in analyzing ancient/historical observations
| 2020-06-24 | [Outburst and Splitting of Interstellar Comet 2I/Borisov](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01242) | + Analysis of outburst and splitting of 2I shows that the split, while significant visually, only accounts for 1e-4 of the original nucleus and will not affect 2I in a significant way <br> + Delayed appearance and rapid disappearance of the fragment is consistent with rotational flare-up of the comet
| 2020-06-25 | [The SiTian project](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01844) | + SiTian will involve 72 1-m telescopes for monitoring and three 4-m telescopes for spectrascopic follow-up of transients of short timescale; data rate 100 PB/yr; current ETA 2030--2032 <br> + Will monitor 10,000 deg^2 in a 30-min cadence down to V=21
