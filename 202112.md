| 2021-12-06 | [Recent formation and likely cometary activity of near-Earth asteroid pair 2019 PR2 -- 2019 QR6](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.01681) | + Studied two Amor D-type NEOs with very similar orbits <br> + Similarity cannot be explained by gravitational perturbation or YORP <br> + Implemented Marsden's comet-like non-gravitational model argues a separation time about 400-700 years ago <br> + Objects not presently active |
| 2021-12-06 | [Mercury as the relic of Earth and Venus' outward migration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00044) | + Citing recent works saying that planet embryos forming early in the innermost part of the pre-solar nebula would have migrated outward <br> + Presented a model arguing that Earth and Venus formed at 0.1-0.5 au and migrated outward, sculpt the Mercury forming region in the process <br> + Explained/predicted isotope difference between Earth and Mars, similarities between Earth and Venus, and Mercury's odd orbit <br> + Some innermost materials (Enstatite Chondrite) may have been scattered into the present asteroid belt |
| 2021-12-06 | [Science with the Ultraviolet Explorer (UVEX)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15608) | + Proposed a 75-cm f/2.7 space telescope with 3.5x3.5 deg FOV optimized for FUV/NUV imaging (1390-2700A down to 24.5 mag AB) |

| 2021-12-06 | [Ultraviolet Observations of Comet 96/P Machholz at Perihelion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15644) | + SOHO/UVCS FUV spectrograph observation; detection of some H, C, O emissions; noted transit of 96P as seen by Solar Orbiter in 2023 |
| 2021-12-19 | [The appearance of a 'fresh' surface on 596 Scheila as a consequence of the 2010 impact event](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04672) | + Significant change of the spectrum of Scheila before and after the 2010 impact (by 10-20% per micron) <br> + Significant reddening beyond about 1 micron <br> + Consistent with simulating space weathering using the Tagish Lake meteorite (that space weathering makes surface of Tagish Lake like objects such as Scheila less red) <br> + Carbon-free, silicate-rich will redden and carbon-rich assemblages will be bluish under space weathering <br> + There might be more outer Solar System objects in the main-belt, hidden by space weathered crust |
