| 2021-11-09 | [The Second Earth Trojan 2020 XL5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05058) | + Follow-up observation and dynamical simulation confirms 2020 XL5 being the second known Earth Trojan <br> + XL5 is a transient ET and has only been at the L4 since the 15th century; frequent encounters with Venus lead to an understable orbit over the timescale of 10 kyr |
| 2021-11-09 | [Spectral properties of near-Earth objects with low-Jovian Tisserand invariant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12193) | + Compiled spectral properties of 150 NEOs with TJ<3.1 <br> + 80% objects with TJ<2.8 shows comet-like spectra, q<0.3 au NEOs are dominated by S-type <br> + Reconfirmed a 1-10% fraction of comet-like NEOs |
| 2021-11-09 | [Physical Characterization of Main-Belt Comet (248370) 2005 QN173](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14822) | + Characterization of QN173, a new MBC; among other things, found a very slow dust ejection speed at 1 m/s indicative of non-sublimation (possibly rapid rotation) ejection mechanism |
