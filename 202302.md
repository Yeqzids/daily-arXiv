| 2023-02-10 | [Comet 108P/Ciffreo: The Blob](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03697) | + 108P had an outburst followed by a nucleus and an offset blob <br> + Used HST + NOT + ZTF and numerical modeling to attempt to explain this morphology <br> + Showed that this morphology is caused by turnaround dust and a very narrow ejection angle, estimated that this only happen to 1% comets |
| 2023-02-10 | [Modelling the 2022 τ-Herculid outburst](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02915) | + Observations + numerical modeling showed that the ejection speed was 4x ordinary speed <br> + TAH meteoroids are very fluffy, only 0.25 gcc <br> + Activities in 2033 and 2049 expected (ZHR=10-50) |
