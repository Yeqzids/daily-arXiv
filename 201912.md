| 2019-12-05 | [Where Did They Come From, Where Did They Go. Grazing Fireballs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01895) | + Examined a gazing fireball (about 10 known in history) detected by DFN <br> + Dynamical simulation shows the object has increased eccentricity after the encounter; in cometary orbit afterwards <br> + Limited mention of atmospheric drag correction
| 2019-12-05 | [Global Site Selection for Astronomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01911) | + Searching for good astronomical sites at 1 km resolution, using cloud cover (MODIS), elevation, light pollution, precipitable water vapor (MODIS), aerosol optical depth for transparency (MODIS), wind speed from a World Bank supported project "Wind Speed Atlas", then use multiple decision factors to decide good sites; identified western Andes and Tibetan Plateau
| 2019-12-07 | [A new approach to generate a catalogue of potential historical novae](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03139) | + Define a procedure of searching for historic novae in Far East (especially Chinese) literature: define fields based on historic report, search modern catalog for counterparts, determine type of objects, and only if all these can be determined accurately, mine the physics <br> + Comparison between fields derived from ancient reports and modern measurements show a good consistency -- the fields are typically 3-5 deg in radius, and the modern positions are less than 6 deg for the few high-confidence cases (Table 6)
