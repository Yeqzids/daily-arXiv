| 2019-09-09 | [Disintegrating In-Bound Long-Period Comet C/2019 J2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01964) | + Two nights of NOT deep images of disntegrated comet C/2019 J2 <br> + Total mass -- 1.2e9 kg, coresponding to a 100-m radius nucleus. Ruled out other causes for disintegration (tidal, sublimation -- note the derivation of sublimation pressure vs compressive strengths, impact), suggest that rotational disruption is a likely cause
